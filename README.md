## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m a backend engineer focused on building high-performance, scalable systemsâ€”and this repository highlights my current exploration into Redis and in-memory data caching as key tools for optimizing backend performance.

As applications grow and traffic scales, the need for faster data access becomes critical. Thatâ€™s what led me to Redisâ€”a powerful, in-memory data store known for its speed, simplicity, and versatility. Iâ€™ve been learning how to use Redis for common backend use cases like caching API responses, storing session data, implementing rate limiting, and queuing tasks for background processing.

This repository includes small projects, code snippets, and learning exercises where I implement caching strategies and integrate Redis into various backend workflows. I'm also experimenting with different data structures Redis providesâ€”like strings, lists, sets, and hashesâ€”to solve real-world challenges in efficient and elegant ways.

Part of this journey also involves understanding cache invalidation, expiration policies, and the trade-offs between consistency and speed. Iâ€™m working on designing systems that not only run faster but also remain predictable and easy to maintain.

The projects here are primarily built using languages and frameworks commonly used in backend development, with Redis acting as a performance booster layer. Each example is written with clarity and includes documentation to help others learning Redis or caching techniques.

If you're also exploring Redis or just curious about how caching can improve system performance, feel free to check out the code, leave feedback, or collaborate on ideas.

Thanks for visiting the repoâ€”and hereâ€™s to building faster, smarter backends! âš¡ðŸ§ ðŸ’¾
